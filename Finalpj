Key Findings:
Regions like North America and Europe tend to have the fastest average download and upload speeds.
The global average download speed has steadily increased over time, particularly from 2010 onward.
A significant proportion of countries fall into the "Moderate" or "Slow" internet speed categories, particularly in regions like Africa and South America.

# Step 6: Conclusion and Recommendations

# 1. Summary of the findings:
print("\n--- Summary of Findings ---")
print("1. The global average download speed has steadily increased, especially from 2010 to the present.")
print("2. North America and Europe have faster download and upload speeds compared to Africa and South America.")
print("3. A large proportion of countries fall under the 'Moderate' and 'Slow' categories, highlighting the need for digital infrastructure improvement in certain regions.")
print("4. Global trends indicate continuous improvements in internet speed, with developed regions driving the growth.")

# 2. Recommendations:
print("\n--- Recommendations ---")
print("1. Policymakers in slower regions should prioritize investments in internet infrastructure to ensure better access.")
print("2. Further analysis could correlate internet speeds with broadband penetration rates or economic indicators (GDP, income levels).")
print("3. For future studies, including data on fiber-optic vs. broadband networks or the impact of 5G could provide deeper insights into internet speed growth.")
print("4. More targeted interventions are needed to close the digital divide between regions with slow internet speeds.")
